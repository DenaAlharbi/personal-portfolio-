        <h1>IoT Agriculture Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our data is about Advanced IoT Agriculture with 30,000 entries and 14 columns that are taken from a
            student's<br>
            master’s thesis research. The data studies the quality of plants that grow in an IoT greenhouse compared to
            other plants <br>
            that grow in a traditional greenhouse, then classified them into 6 different classes according to some
            significant <br>
            features such as:<br>
            Average of chlorophyll in the plant (ACHP), which has a main role in plants' nutrition by performing
            photosynthesis process<br>
            , average root diameter (ARD), which is directly connected to the plants ability to absorb water and
            nutrients from the soil, <br>
            and plant height rate (PHR), which is measuring the dynamic growth of the plant over time and directly
            affected by the plants nutrition.<br>

            Since most of our team members are from computer-related majors, we selected this data because it develops a
            new technological<br>
            footprint in one of the most important life fields which can enhance automation in smart greenhouses.<br>

            No doubt it is difficult to classify such problems, especially when we consider the high dimensionality <br>
            of data gained from containing many columns and the possibility of unexpected environmental external factors
            impact.<br>
            However, classifying the data can give meaningful results.<br>
