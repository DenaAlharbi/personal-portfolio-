## üß† Reflection

Using AI helped me move faster, especially when debugging layout quirks or exploring design ideas. I always reviewed,
customized, and refined the suggestions to match my personal style and goals. The final portfolio reflects my own
decisions, creativity, and technical skill‚Äîwith AI as a supportive tool, not a substitute.

## üöÄ Future Use of AI

In future projects, I plan to continue using AI tools to accelerate development and enhance quality. This includes leveraging AI for accessibility audits, performance optimization, semantic HTML structuring, and creative ideation. I also aim to explore AI-assisted testing and documentation generation to streamline workflows while maintaining full authorship and oversight.
