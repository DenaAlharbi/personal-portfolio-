## 🎯 Purpose of AI Integration

This report outlines how AI tools were used to support the design, development, and refinement of my personal portfolio
website. The goal was to enhance productivity, troubleshoot layout issues, and explore creative design ideas while
maintaining full ownership of the final product.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Microsoft Copilot** – for layout debugging, design suggestions, and creative brainstorming
- **ChatGPT** – for occasional syntax checks and UI inspiration
-**A website** - for reusable components was used [https://codepen.io/simoberny/pen/pJZJQY](https://codepen.io/simoberny/pen/pJZJQY)

## 📌 Areas Where AI Was Used

### 1. Layout Troubleshooting

- Debugged errors
- Refined modal and dropdown behavior for the contact section

### 2. Responsive Design

- Suggested flexbox strategies for centering `.intro-wrapper`
- Helped contain overflowing content inside scrollable containers
- Provided CSS transitions and javascript code for smooth section opening

### 3. Creative Enhancements

- Brainstormed animation ideas for section reveals
- Helped with refining and enhancing my css code
- Added comments to the code to make the project maintainable
- Proposed typography pairings and gradient overlays
- Offered README and docs structure and branding language

### 4. Code Optimization

- Recommended to add texture to the website using https://www.transparenttextures.com/
- Suggested semantic HTML improvements and suggestion on how should my content be grouped

## Chat Snippets Examples

<img src="./Docs-images/snip4.png" alt="Form Design" width="300" />
<img src="./Docs-images/snip3.png" alt="Form Design" width="300" />
<img src="./Docs-images/snip2.png" alt="Form Design" width="300" />
<img src="./Docs-images/snip1.png" alt="Form Design" width="300" /><br>
>  🧾 Ethical Note :<br> All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed and edited by me to ensure originality, accuracy, and alignment with my personal style and goals. I maintained full creative and technical control throughout the project.<br>

For example:
  <img src="./Docs-images/snip5.png" alt="Form Design" width="300" /><br>
- In this example I made the copilot convert the units to responsive just to amek the process faster and then i tested it and every time there would be something to change. So because i understand my code i would tweak the numbers until it looks perfect.<br><br>
  <img src="./Docs-images/snip6.png" alt="Form Design" width="300" /><br>

- Here I was trying to figure out the javascript of making sections open and i have no experience in this so i asked for the structure and tweaked it to fit my class names and purpose. AI made the process easier and faster but mistakes were still found!

## 🧠 Reflection

Using AI helped me move faster, especially when debugging layout quirks or exploring design ideas. I always reviewed,
customized, and refined the suggestions to match my personal style and goals. The final portfolio reflects my own
decisions, creativity, and technical skill—with AI as a supportive tool, not a substitute.

## 🚀 Future Use of AI

In future projects, I plan to continue using AI tools to accelerate development and enhance quality. This includes
leveraging AI for accessibility audits, performance optimization, semantic HTML structuring, and creative ideation. I
also aim to explore AI-assisted testing and documentation generation to streamline workflows while maintaining full
authorship and oversight.
